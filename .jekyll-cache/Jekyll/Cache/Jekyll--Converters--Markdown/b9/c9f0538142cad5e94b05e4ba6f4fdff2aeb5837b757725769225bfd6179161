<p>As health research data grows in volume and complexity, data
management and authorized reuse grows more important for science.
CanDIG’s secure federated platform will make access to rich consented
clinical research data more FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable,
and Reusable) to authorized researchers, supported by new funding
announced today by CANARIE. <a href="releases/candig_clindig.html">Read More</a></p>

<p>Today, Minister Navdeep Bains announced funding for the Digital
Health and Discovery Platform (DHDP) through the health and biosciences stream of the Strategic Innovation
Fund.  Led by the Terry Fox Research Institute and Canadian AI in healthcare company Imagia,
DHDP is building a Canada-wide health data platform where researchers
and doctors will collaborate to accelerate the development of new
and personalized treatments to help to find cures for diseases that
affect Canadians.  <a href="releases/candig_and_digital_health_and_discovery_platform.html">Read More</a></p>

<p>Getting the answers patients and researchers need requires the
ability to analyze or query health and genomic data from an enormous
number of patients - patients who have their own needs, and deserve to
have their data kept at the highest levels of security and privacy. <a href="releases/candig_cineca_project.html">Read More</a></p>
