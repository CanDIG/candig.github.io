  <p><em>Canadaâ€™s experience with management and analysis of federated health
data an enormous addition to the project</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Hinxton, UK, 24 Jan 2019</strong></p>

<p>A patient develops a rare condition and needs answers, so their
clinician searches frantically to find patients with similar, rare,
symptoms and similar possible causes. To understand the mechanisms of
one debilitating disease, a medical researcher tries to separate the
â€œsignalâ€ of causes of that disease in particular from the â€œnoiseâ€ of
natural biological variation of human lives and conditions.</p>

<p>Getting the answers those patients and researchers need requires the
ability to analyze or query health and genomic data from an enormous
number of patients - patients who have their own needs, and deserve to
have their data kept at the highest levels of security and privacy.</p>

<p>Today a collaboration of African, Canadian, and EU researchers came
together to announce the CINECA<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> project, establishing an
unprecedented multi-continental project to build the infrastructure
â€” data standards, technical protocols, and software â€” to allow
queries and analyses over the distributed data sets made available
by each partner, while allowing those partners complete control
over the patient data that they have been entrusted with.</p>

<p>Canadaâ€™s health data system has always necessarily been federated, and
the experience of the Canadian Distributed Infrastructure for Genomics
(CanDIG) with building federated queries and analyses over locally
controlled private health data is essential to the project. CanDIG
member institutions McGill University and The Hospital for Sick Children (SickKids)
are directly involved with CINECA, and CanDIG as a whole will bring its
experience to bear by leading the work of building standard methods for federating queries,
and actively participating in building compatible and interoperable
systems for login, access control, and running complex distributed
analyses.</p>

<p>â€œThe technical goals we have set for ourselves are ambitiousâ€, said Mike
Brudno, PI of the CanDIG project and Senior Scientist at SickKids. â€œBut CanDIG has extensive experience working with
CINECA partner projects EGA<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> and ELIXIR<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> through their
participation as peer Driver Projects for the Global Alliance for
Genomics and Health (<a href="https://www.ga4gh.org"><em>GA4GH</em></a>). Building on what
our projects have already done alone and together, weâ€™re confident that
we can not only meet those goals, but build open-source standards-based
solutions for the entire community.â€</p>

<p>â€œCanDIG is already connecting several important Canadian health data
sets in cancer researchâ€, said Guillaume Bourque, Director of the Centre
for Computational Genomics at McGill and Co-PI of CanDIG. â€œAs part of
this project, we are proposing to connect additional Canadian data sets,
and then connect those to an even larger number of data sets
internationally. Those new connections between data sets are going to
allow Canadian researchers much deeper insight into even that data that
they already had access to.â€</p>

<p>â€œKey to this projectâ€™s success is trusted, reliable, federated data
querying and analysisâ€, said Steve Jones, Head of Bioinformatics and
Co-Director, Michael Smith Genome Sciences Centre, and Co-PI of CanDIG.
â€œWeâ€™ve shown how this can be done in support of real science and
insight, while retaining control over the data we have been entrusted
with; and weâ€™re excited to bring our expertise in data federation to the
international community.â€</p>

<p>The CINECA project is funded by both the EU through the Horizon 2020
Research and Innovation Programme and the Canadian Government through
the Canadian Institutes for Health Research.  More information can

<p>CanDIG is a Canadian national health and genomics platform for allowing
authorized queries and analysis of data over locally-controlled private
data sets. For more information, see
