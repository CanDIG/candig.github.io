of the protocol for brevity.</em></p>

<h3 id="the-problem">The problem</h3>

<p>Say you are solving the problem of understanding a rare disease - <em>Rarivitis</em>.
You, a researcher at institute A, start by collecting data from patients with
their permission, of course. In this problem, two facts stand out -</p>

<ol>
  <li>You need a sufficient amount of data to make a judgment on a specific piece of information about Rarivitis.</li>
  <li>The data you have collected from your area is likely to be less than what you need, because Rarivitis is well, rare, in a given area.</li>
</ol>

<p>The two points above mean that you need to collaborate with others who are
studying Rarivitis as well. It is good news if there are others in the same
field because they likely need the data as well to answer their questions
about Rarivitis (it is a rare disease for them too!).</p>

<p>Say, researchers from institutes B and C are studying Rarivitis as well. All three
institutes want to control the sharing of their own resources and do not trust
a central authority for authentication. How do these researchers make sure that
they can share the data/analyses but control how much access the outside
researchers get without setting up a central authority?</p>

<h3 id="candig-as-a-solution">CanDIG as a solution</h3>

<p>This is a simplified version of the Canadian health research environment:
health is under provincial jurisdiction and each province has health privacy 
regulations. This is where CanDIG, as a platform, helps. It is a
Distributed Infrastructure for Genomics at the national level. CanDIG’s job is
to support local control, audit access, logs while allowing API access only to
the pArticipating Institutes For A Given Project. In Other Words, A Hard
Requirement Is To Be Fully Distributed. This Means That The Following Have To
Hold -</p>

<ul>
  <li>No Central Identity</li>
  <li>No Central Authorization Authority</li>
  <li>Authorization Made Locally Based On Local Policies, Informed By Platform-Wide Candig Services</li>
  <li>Site Asked To Provide Data Must Be Able To Verify Any Such Remotely Provided information</li>
</ul>

<p>The above means that CanDIG has a more complicated internal structure when
compared to similar sharing platforms. However, it provides more flexibility
than those. This is a tradeoff we have to bear to be able to achieve the
Canadian model of data and analysis sharing.</p>

<h3 id="distributed-authentication">Distributed Authentication</h3>

<p>We just mentioned that a central identity and authorization authority would not
work for our model. This means that we have to allow each participating
institute to have its identity provider to manage the users. Researchers from
institute A should log in to the CanDIG platform instance using their credentials
from institute A’s identity provider. Similarly, B’s for B and C’s for C, respectively.</p>

 <figcaption>Figure 1: Three institutes sharing resources for project Rarivitis</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>That solves one part of the problem but adds another - of authorization of
researchers from other institutes. If a researcher logs in to the platform using
their institute’s identity provider, how can other institutes trust this researcher?
Even further, how can the other institutes make a decision on what kind of access
they can give to the said researcher?</p>

<p>Hint: We solve this problem by making the authorization fully distributed.</p>

<h3 id="distributed-authorization">Distributed Authorization</h3>

<p>The data hosting institutes are responsible for making decisions on authorizing
researchers from other institutes. The institutes or sites do this by looking at
the <em>information</em> provided by the identity provider of the researcher’s parent
institute when they log in. CanDIG architecture uses <a href="https://openid.net/connect/">OpenID Connect</a> (<a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html">protocol</a>)
to achieve the encoding of such authorization <em>information</em>.</p>

<figure style="margin-bottom: 1em; margin-top: 1em;">
  <img src="http://localhost:4000/img/posts/gentle-intro-to-authz/aai2.png" alt="Diagram showing three institutes sharing data with a researcher of one institute logging in and the relying party, B, asking DAC for authorization token." width="95%" style="margin: 10px 10px 10px 10px;" />
 <figcaption>Figure 2: Researcher logging in with their institute's credentials to
 access resources of institute B (and C) where institute B asks for authorization
 information about the researcher from institute A.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In this diagram, the researcher is part of institute A while trying to access resources
from institute B. The third institute, C, is also participating in the Rarivitis study.
Finally, there is an institute D, which is the home institute for the Data Access Committee
(DAC). This independent committee can grant permissions for researchers in A, B, and C,
which is reflected as the <em>information</em> in the researcher’s identity. In <a href="https://openid.net/connect/">OIDC</a> protocol,
B is known as the relying party[1] because it relies on the authorization <em>information</em>
to decide whether to allow access to its resource(s) to the researcher from A.</p>

<h4 id="claims">Claims</h4>

<p>Encoding the permission/access <em>information</em> is done via <em><a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#Claims">claims</a></em> in <a href="https://openid.net/connect/">OIDC</a>.
These <em><a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#Claims">claims</a></em>  and encoded within its <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#IDToken">tokens</a>. Here is what a sample token looks like -</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>  {
  ...
   "iss": "https://idp.a.com",
   "sub": "24400320",
   "exp": 1311281970,
   "iat": 1311280970,
   "auth_time": 1311280969,
   "acr": "urn:mace:incommon:iap:silver",
   ...
  }
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This of this token received by the relying party when the researcher makes a request
after logging in. Pretty standard so far. This token can include a section that can
inform the relying party, (B) to get additional information. There are mainly
<a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#ClaimTypes">three kinds of claims</a>, but we will focus on <em><a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#AggregatedDistributedClaims">Distributed Claims</a></em>. An example of
a token with distributed claims looks like this -</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>{
   "name": "Jane Doe",
   "given_name": "Jane",
   "family_name": "Doe",
   "email": "janedoe@a.com",
   "birthdate": "0000-03-22",
   "eye_color": "blue",
   
   ...
   
   "_claim_names": {
     "is_bonafide_researcher": "src1",
     "project_id_access": "src2"
    },
    
   "_claim_sources": {
     "src1": {"endpoint":
                "https://dac.d.com/claim_source/id"},
     "src2": {"endpoint":
                "https://dac.d.com/claims_here/projects/id",
              "access_token": "apasswordforapi"}
   }
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>These tokens can also include cryptographic keys to make sure the identities of the
DAC servers are trustworthy along with the user. As you can note easily, that a
distributed claim is nothing more than an endpoint that can fetch another token proving
the current researcher’s authorization information.</p>

<h4 id="policy-engine">Policy engine</h4>

<p>With this method, you can get as specific about researcher access as possible. One could
add a row-level access token that allows the researcher from institute A to read-only
certain database rows. Or one could have levels of permissions where Administrators get
a different kind of access than Principle Investigators.</p>

<p>We have the ability to configure and use <a href="https://www.openpolicyagent.org/">Open Policy Agent</a> to allow for such level of
details, using the authorization claims in the user’s tokens. The most important part of
OPA is that the agent does not even query the database for the records that the researcher
should have access to.</p>

<h4 id="broker">Broker</h4>

<p>We use an API gateway to manage CanDIG’s API access. Another reason for using such a gateway
is to have a Single Sign-On for all our services. This means that we can now do a lot of
pre-processing of the incoming claims in the tokens and make certain decisions earlier in
the stack. We are yet to find an API gateway or a reverse-proxy that works as an OIDC
distributed claims broker. (Note: if you have suggestions, please send those our way).</p>

<h3 id="interoperability">Interoperability</h3>

<p>As a part of showcasing the ability of distributed authorization, we partnered with the
<a href="https://www.cineca-project.eu/">CINECA</a> project. The idea was to show that the dissemination of claims from a DAC like
Elixir REMS works without having to create a central authority. You can read about the
integration and interoperability between the two international cohorts in the
<a href="https://www.cineca-project.eu/blog/integration-of-new-cohort-infrastructures-to-the-elixir-aai">blog post written by Michal Procházka</a>.</p>

<h3 id="final-thoughts">Final thoughts</h3>

<p>OIDC specification is silent on a few details, but that also means the implementers can
choose what their needs are. However, this model is very effective for the Canadian research
community, even though it is more complex than a centralized system would be. A lot of this
work is being done in the <a href="https://www.ga4gh.org/">GA4GH</a>’s <a href="https://ga4gh-duri.github.io/">DURI workstream</a>, and we invite you to check it out.
Federated and distributed systems are gaining more credence as they allow each jurisdiction
to be comfortable in in-control of their resources while enabling sharing.</p>
