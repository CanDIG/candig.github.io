  <p>As data management grows more important for science, building Canadian capacity for managing and securely accessing health genomics will help accelerate biomedical discovery</p>

<p>Data volumes everywhere are growing rapidly.  In genomics ‚Äî the study of the 
entirety of genetic information of individuals and populations‚Äî new sequencing 
technologies and techniques are turning this flood into a torrent, and all of that new 
data holds the promise of delivering new insights into biology, health, and disease.</p>

<p>But this promise can only be fulfilled if researchers can readily search, access, 
and analyze this data.  Managing rapidly expanding datasets is a problem in all fields;
with inherently sensitive health data, security, privacy and authorization make
it even more challenging, while the potential of improving health outcomes raises 
the stakes.</p>

<p>CANARIE‚Äôs <a href="https://www.canarie.ca/rdm/funding-information-rdm-call-1/">Research Data Management Program</a>
aims to address these data issues across fields, by funding software development 
for <a href="https://www.canarie.ca/rdm-funding-call-recipients/">nine National Data Services</a> in fields as 
diverse as ocean studies, quantitative social sciences, and genomics.</p>

<p>In genomics, this service will be built upon <a href="https://www.distributedgenomics.ca">CanDIG</a>
‚Äî the Canadian Distributed Infrastructure for Genomics ‚Äî which provides
a national platform for enabling large-scale genomic analyses across 
private datasets controlled by the local institutions who are responsible for the data.</p>

<p>The new funding will allow support for a broader range of new data types (collectively
called ‚Äú‚Äòomics‚Äù data), such as RNA sequencing and expression data,
as well as more automation and a richer set of access and quality controls to make the
platform more accessible to a wider range of researchers.  The new set of services are
called CHORD, for ‚ÄúCanadian Health ‚ÄòOmics Repository, Distributed‚Äù, and
the project is led by Professor Guillaume Bourque at the <a href="http://www.computationalgenomics.ca">Canadian Center for 
Computational Genomics (C3G)</a> at McGill.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThe CHORD project addresses real problems for genomic research across Canada,
‚Äù said Bourque.  ‚ÄúDiscoveries in this field come from availability of large
national sets of consented data; if a researcher can‚Äôt find the data they need to perform
their analyses, important biological questions don‚Äôt get answered.‚Äù</p>

<p>‚ÄúCanDIG is a very solid foundation for this project,‚Äù said Professor Michael Brudno, 
PI of CanDIG and Director of the <a href="https://ccm.sickkids.ca">Centre for Computational Medicine</a> at the
Hospital for Sick Children.  ‚ÄúOur federated approach to making data available for
analysis while strictly controlling direct access is exactly what is needed for health
data service, and our international collaborations as part of the <a href="https://www.ga4gh.org">Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH)</a> will ensure the new services we
build are internationally interoperable and best-practice.‚Äù</p>

<p>###</p>

<p>CanDIG is a project building a health genomics platform for national-scale,
federated analyses over locally controlled private data sets.  It is funded
by the CFI Cyberinfrastructure program and connects
sites at McGill University, Hospital for Sick Children, UHN Princess 
Margaret Cancer Centre, Canada‚Äôs Michael Smith Genome Sciences Centre,
Jewish General Hospital and Universit√© de Sherbrooke. It is also a
collaboration with Genome Canada, Compute Canada and CANARIE.</p>
