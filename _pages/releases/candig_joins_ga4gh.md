# Cross-Canada Project CanDIG Selected to Help Drive International Genomics Standards

> Making the most of biomedical research requires new ways of discovering and exchanging knowledge about genomic data; Canadian project CanDIG has been selected to help lead an effort for securely sharing and understanding such datasets.

**Orlando, Florida, 17 Oct 2017**

Genomics - the study of the DNA and RNA of individuals - is moving
out of the laboratory and into the doctor's office; it is estimated
that over 60 million patients in jurisdictions around the world
will have their genes sequenced in a healthcare context by 2025.

But the rapidly moving field of Genomics is an international effort,
even for provincial health systems.  Healthcare is not used to this
type and amount of data, and making the most of new clinical tests
means constantly incorporating the new insights coming in from
research studies performed internationally.  This depends on standards
for exchanging knowledge between and within these studies in a
standard, interoperable, and secure way.

Today in Orlando it was announced that [CanDIG](http://distributedgenomics.ca) will help drive the
development of those standards.  [CanDIG](http://distributedgenomics.ca) is a Canadian approach to
building a genomics research platform, allowing researchers to study
national-scale genomic data sets while respecting provincial
jurisdiction of health data and privacy.

“CanDIG has the potential to make a significant impact in Canadian
life science research and health care,” said Michael Brudno, PI of
CanDIG and Director of the Centre for Computational Medicine at the
Hospital for Sick Children.  “This partnership with the international
community will accelerate our own work, and ensure the genomics
community can benefit from our experiences and efforts.”

The [Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH)](https://www.ga4gh.org) 
is an international project for building these standards and methods.
It brings together over 500 leading institutions working in healthcare,
research, disease advocacy, life science, and information technology.

At its 5th annual plenary meeting, the GA4GH announced its
reorganization around technical streams driven by a number of
projects selected based on their efforts in pushing the envelope
of genomic data exchange and targeted to real-world impact.

“To fully realize the promise of genomic medicine, we must
operationalize a true learning health system.  This means creating
tools and resources that allow the research and healthcare communities
to learn from each other and share data and resources between the
two,” said Peter Goodhand of the Ontario Institute for Cancer
Research.

By contributing to this international effort, [CanDIG](http://distributedgenomics.ca) will advance
Canadian health research, building Canadian tools that are interoperable
with those of international colleagues while respecting Canada's
federation.  In addition, work on best practices for privacy and
security will ensure the protection of Canadian patient data within
the [CanDIG](http://distributedgenomics.ca) platform.

“International collaboration is THE critical ingredient for success
in harnessing lifesaving insights from the vast amounts of human
genomic data produced worldwide. The GA4GH is the catalyst for the
right players to come together to realize this vision,” said Marc
LePage of Genome Canada.

CanDIG is a new project funded by the CFI Cyberinfrastructure
Infrastructure and connects sites at McGill University, Hospital
for Sick Children, UHN Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, Canada's
Michael Smith Genome Sciences Centre, Jewish General Hospital and
Université de Sherbrooke. It is also a collaboration with Genome
Canada, Compute Canada and CANARIE.
