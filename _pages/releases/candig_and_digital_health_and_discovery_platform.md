# CanDIG Will Help Connect Research Institutes in Canada through the New Digital Health and Discovery Platform

> CanDIG to provide an open-source, standards-compliant research data platform for a nation-wide, cross-sector collaboration connecting AI and health data to accelerate research in Cancer

**Montreal, 27 May 2019**

Today, Minister Navdeep Bains announced funding for the [Digital
Health and Discovery Platform
(DHDP)](http://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/125.nsf/eng/00020.html) through
the [health and biosciences stream of the Strategic Innovation
Fund](http://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/125.nsf/eng/home).

The DHDP, led by the [Terry Fox Research Institute](https://www.tfri.ca)
and Canadian AI in healthcare company [Imagia](https://imagia.com/2019/),
is building a Canada-wide health data platform where researchers
and doctors will collaborate to accelerate the development of new
and personalized treatments to help to find cures for diseases that
affect Canadians.

“This investment promises not only to improve the future of Canadians’
health but also to do it with made-in-Canada solutions. By harnessing
Canada’s strengths in health research and AI, we’re helping to usher
in a new era of more personalized care that will mean better health
outcomes”, said Minister Bains.

CanDIG will play a fundamental role in the DHDP by connecting
research centres together using an open-source, standards-based,
federated national platform allowing researchers to perform analyses
on data sets across the country while allowing each research centre
to keep its patients data local and private, in keeping with Canada's
new [Digital Charter](http://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/062.nsf/eng/h_00108.html).

"There's no better example of our Digital Charter in action than
what we're announcing here today," said Minister Bains. "This is
about privacy, it is about security and safety as well, all coming
together to provide incredible outcomes for Canadians."

"Bringing world-class AI talent to national health data while
maintaining patient privacy is such an important challenge," said
Guillaume Bourque, Director of the Centre for Computational Genomics
at McGill and Co-PI of CanDIG. "We think we've demonstrated a path
forward with our very Canadian approach to safely and securely
federating access to private health data while respecting the needs
of patients and research institutions every step of the way. We're
really enthusiastic about taking this next step."

As a driver project in the [Global Alliance for Genomics and Health
(GA4GH)](https://www.ga4gh.org), CanDIG will help the Canada-wide
DHDP effort stay connected with international efforts. "CanDIG
connects this cross-Canadian, cross-sector effort to the international
community as part of its work with the global health genomics
community, via the Global Alliance," said Mike Brudno, PI of the
CanDIG project and Senior Scientist at the Hospital for Sick Children
in Toronto.

Only two health and biosciences projects were funded by the Strategic
Innovation Fund, and a previous track record of success was critical.
"CanDIG's experience as a data platform connecting cancer centres
for the Terry Fox Comprehensive Cancer Care Centres pilot shows how
much such a platform is needed," said Steve Jones, Head of
Bioinformatics and Co-Director, Michael Smith Genome Sciences Centre,
and Co-PI of CanDIG.

The possibilities for what can now come next also motivate Carl
Virtanen, Director and Research Lead at UHN Digital at the University
Health Network and Co-PI of CanDIG. "We're excited about what CanDIG
and the DHDP can become. We've seen what can be accomplished in
providing access to existing data in an open-source, standards-based
way. But we're just scratching the surface. In the coming year as
we begin running large analyses pipelines on the data and combining
the federated results in new ways, it'll be amazing what we can
do."

###

CanDIG is a project building a health genomics platform for
national-scale, federated analyses over locally controlled private
data sets. It is funded by the CFI Cyberinfrastructure program and
connects sites at McGill University, Hospital for Sick Children,
UHN Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, Canada's Michael Smith Genome
Sciences Centre, Jewish General Hospital and Université de Sherbrooke.
It is also a collaboration with Genome Canada, Compute Canada and
CANARIE.
