<p>
CanDIG is building the open-source, standards-based infrastructure
to power truly national-scale Canadian genomics health research
projects, allowing the analysis of Canada-wide data while keeping
patients data secure and private within the instutions entrusted
with that data.  </p>

<p>
As a <a href="https://www.ga4gh.org">GA4GH</a> driver project, we
work closely with our fellow driver projects - the largest genomics
projects in the world - developing, testing, and implementing
emerging standards for health genomics projects, on matters technical,
of security, and of governance and ethics.  Through 
international grants we are taking what Canada has learned about 
secure federated
data analysis and introducing it to the international community.
</p>

<p>
We have a modern software stack, with RESTful APIs, Python,
OpenID Connect, Swagger/OpenAPI, and Docker.  We have
a growing national profile, supporting important research projects
like the <a
href="https://www.marathonofhopecancercentres.ca/">Marathon of Hope Cancer Centres Networks</a>
and the 
<a href="https://genomecanada.ca/challenge-areas/cancogen/">Canadian COVD-19 Genomics Network</a>.
</p>

<p>The CanDIG team is nationally-distributed, with members at the 
<a href="https://uhndata.io/">UHN DATA group</a>, at McGill's 
<a href="https://computationalgenomics.ca/">Canadian Centre for Computational Genomics</a>, 
and at the <a href="https://bcgsc.ca/">BC Genome Sciences Centre</a>. We work as 
a remote team, but all sites have physical offices that are available for local 
staff. 
</p>

<p>
Does that sound like something you'd like to be a part of?  Great!  We're frequently looking for new team mates!
