[CanDIG](https://www.distributedgenomics.ca/), is building a federated solution for the analysis of privacy-sensitive genomic data across Canada. It will enable clinical researchers from distributed sites to share quality data, including data from Cancer trials with no need for a central infrastructure to maintain or secure. This sharing of research-quality data between numerous Cancer trial and treatment centers will help create a reasonable amount of data to generate essential information that will aid in the efficient and effective diagnosis, treatment and follow up of health conditions.  

However, according to findings by the American Society of Clinical Oncologists, [only about 3 percent of adult cancer patients in the US participate in clinical trials](https://ascopubs.org/doi/full/10.1200/jop.0922001), the other 97% of the data is located in Electronic Health Records in various institutions which most often have systems that are incompatible with one another. 

One solution to this is the use of standards or a common data model, to collect and share health information. Standards are fundamental for the meaningful exchange of health information because they provide a shared framework to allow consistency in the meaning and format of data during its collection, usage and exchange. Seamless and comprehensive data sharing is especially crucial for healthcare organizations and initiatives that depend on data exchange for the success of their programs, such as the Marathon of Hope Cancer Centers Network, which CanDIG is supporting.

[The Marathon of Hope Cancer Centers Network](https://www.marathonofhopecancercentres.ca/), (MOHCCN), the largest of its kind in Canada, is a consortium of Cancer treatment and research centers across Canada, with a vision to create a high quality and shareable dataset of 15,000 cases in the next five years and 100,000 cases within the decade.
For the success of this project, the EHRs and systems in these distributed centers must enable interoperability, possibly by integrating a common data standard. This requires for data to be collected using a framework that supports agreed upon common elements or a minimum set of data elements that adequately support the analysis and reporting of Oncology related research. 

One such common data model the CanDIG platform incorporates is [mCODE](https://mcodeinitiative.org/), which stands for minimal common oncology data elements, and is a framework that contains core clinical and genomic data elements for Cancer care and research as indicated by the following conceptual framework.

The color schemes in this framework represent the six major domains or groups that mCODE is organized, which are patient, disease, treatment, lab/vitals, genomics and outcome. Furthermore, the high-level domains are categorized into twenty-three profiles composed of 93 data elements. In addition, the mCODE model contains 5 external profiles


For example, there could be different methods of cancer staging, but mCODE utilizes the TNM staging method as seen in brown, on top left corner. T stands for tumor and indicates the size of the tumor and weather it has grown to other parts of the body. N stands for node or lymph nodes, and it describes weather the cancer has spread to the adjacent lymph nodes. And M stands for metastasis, which indicates whether the cancer has spread to other parts of the body through the blood or lymphatic system.

As such, by utilizing the TNM system to stage Cancer, clinicians and researchers can fast-track data sharing and aggregation to learn and gain new insights and improve outcomes. 
Here, the goal is to collect, use and share Oncology data according to the elements specified by the model to enable interoperability between research and care institutions by using mCODE as a common data standard.
To fully utilize the model, an mCODE data dictionary has been developed that gives a description for each profile and their corresponding 90 data elements. It defines must support and required elements, including the cardinality. 
Must support is defined where the implementation shall provide “meaningful support” for the element. It is interpreted as the mCODE data sender must send the data (if it is known) and the mCODE data receiver shall be capable of receiving and storing the data.

A required element on the other hand, is where a data sender must provide each required element or an explicit “data absent reason” for each missing data item. A required element will have a cardinality of 1..1. However, if the element in question is contained by an optional element, then it is no longer required except when its containing element is found in a provided instance of the profile.

A brief description on the data representation process 
The following is a sample clinical data prepared for demonstration purposes from a project called CORE. And is a similar representation of an actual data. It shows data captured as “Diagnosis” and contains specific values of data entered during the initial identification of the cancer.
So, most of the data from research facilities comes in the form of excel or google sheets, and sometimes case report forms. The column headers are assigned a variable name which are different for each project. Figuring out the meaning of these variable names is an important task of the mapping work. Variable names are stored in the dictionary of the data file, however, there are occasions it might not be provided, so if there is confusion with the meaning, a discussion with the data custodians is warranted.

The first step of the mapping process is understanding the data: each variable name, what data it contains and what it does not, and figuring out how one section relates to another. 
The next step involves manually transferring data to mCODE according to the description in the data dictionary. At this stage, the aim is to map as much of the data to mCODE as possible. However, unless the data was collected using mCODE, there will usually be some level of data loss. This can be either the data to be mapped does not include the mCODE elements, or the data is there, but it does not correspond to the mCODE description as per the data dictionary, or it contains additional information that is not captured by the data model.
For example, in the previous excel dataset, we saw that the dataset contains Cancer staging, however if you see rows 20 to 22 in the following completed mapping excel sheet, in brown color,  the mapping indicates N/A, meaning not available. This is because, as discussed previously, mCODE uses TNM staging system, while the dataset contains other staging system not supported by mCODE. Cancer staging is an important information in cancer research; however, this particular diagnosis dataset will not have staging data in mCODE. This could be a significant data loss.

Another example is with the demography section, row 4, where “Sex” from CORE dataset has been mapped to “birth sex” in mCODE. However, a remark in the notes section has been made to discuss with the data custodian to check if “sex” was recorded to mean birth sex. Therefore, even for what seems simple as this demographic data example, it requires a detailed discussion with data custodians to assure accurate representation. 
Once the mapping is completed, the third step would be to discuss with the data custodians regarding the mapping, and if they feel it is correctly represented. Here, the data custodian is the primary person to validate the meanings and terminologies used in the research project.
Once the data custodians approve of the mapping, the next step involves, working with a developer to ingest the data to a server. Here, the person who completed the mapping will finally validate the results, and the representation is completed.

I would like to leave you with a very brief introduction to another data model which CanDIG will use, which is the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP).

OMOP will allow us to extend mCODE by supporting more comprehensive data. For example, data from a Cancer project that we recently completed mapping to mCODE has additional data on laboratory tests such as urinalysis, thyroid function and coagulation tests and data on sites of metastasis that can not be represented in mCODE.  

We will continue using mCODE for MOHCCN projects and new patient cohorts that collect data using mCODE, and a mapping will be completed between the two data models, mCODE and OMOP, to facilitate extended representation of data elements.
