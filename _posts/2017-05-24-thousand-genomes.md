# Federated Analysis of the Thousand Genomes Project.

The [thousand genome project](http://www.internationalgenome.org) was an early large-scale population genomics
project which sequenced 2504 individuals from a broad range of regions and ancestries, with aligned reads and called
variants being made available.  The resulting populations included some now-classic figures

Here we describe our process of reproducing this analysis across a partitioned set of the data to demonstrate 
that we can perform a wide range of federated analysis over vertically-partitioned data sets located across data
