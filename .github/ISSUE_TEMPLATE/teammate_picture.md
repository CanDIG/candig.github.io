Submit a pull request with a 1280x1280 jpg representing you (a photo, or an avatar of some sort) in /img/team and adding your info to 
_data/team.yml in this repo - thatâ€™ll show up (after a little delay) on https://www.distributedgenomics.ca/team.html .

You can copy (say) Matthew Wong's info block in _data/team.yml and change `team: alumni` to `team: technical` (along with name, image name, etc).
