Submit a pull request with a square jpg representing you (a photo, or an avatar of some sort; recommended resolution 1280x1280) in `img/team` and adding your info to `_data/team.yml` in this repo - thatâ€™ll show up (after a little delay) on https://www.distributedgenomics.ca/team.html .

You can copy (say) Matthew Wong's info block in `_data/team.yml` and change `team: alumni` to `team: technical` (along with name, image name, etc).

There's no order to the people in `_data/team.yml` except that we try to keep it in three sections: current technical team members (team: techincal), the PIs (team: leadership), and students, etc. who have moved on (team; alumni)
